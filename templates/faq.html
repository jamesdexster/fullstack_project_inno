            The post-soviet country of Chernarus is struck by an unknown virus, turning the majority population into frenzied infected. Fighting over resources has bred a hostile mentality among survivors, driving whatâ€™s left of humanity to collapse. You are one of the few immune to the virus - how far will you go to survive?

            This is DayZ, this is your story.
            DayZ is an unforgiving, authentic, open world sandbox online game where each one of 60 players on a server follows a single goal - to survive as long as they can, by all means necessary. There are no superficial tips, waypoints, built-in tutorials or help given to you. Every decision matters - with no save games, and no extra lives, every mistake can be lethal. If you fail, you lose everything and start over.

            DayZ is an incredible experience, however, if you require a fully polished title and are not prepared to deal with the consequences of playing a game that is still undergoing heavy and complicated changes, then DayZ may not be right for you. Development of the game is still ongoing despite an official release labeled 1.0. Bugs and issues are still common, and many previously planned or introduced features are still due to be implemented in the Enfusion engine. Despite this, the game is one-of-a-kind, and you will struggle to find a gaming experience that does large-scale multiplayer zombie survival like DayZ.
